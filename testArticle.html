In 1910, the government of Alberta Premier <a href="#" title="Alexander Cameron Rutherford">Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a> was embroiled in the <a href="#" title="Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal">Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal</a>.

When other prominent Liberals declined it, the position was offered to Sifton. As Premier, he smoothed over the divisions in the party that had caused and been exacerbated by the railway scandal. He made attempts to break with the Rutherford railway policy; when they were rebuffed by the courts, he adopted a course similar to Rutherford's. He unsuccessfully pursued the transfer of rights over Alberta's natural resources from the federal government, which had retained them by the terms of Alberta's provincehood.
